## Ingredients
- 30ml Coconut syrup/cream/milk (either one)
- 120ml Pineapple Juice
- 1 Piece of Pineapple as garnish (optional)
- 30ml Whipped cream (whipped/non-whipped)
- 100g Ice cubes

## Materials
- Powerful mixer with ice-crushing option (optional)

## Method
1. Put ice cubes in the mixxer and make crushed ice (optional)
2. Put ice cubes/crushed-ice into mixxer glass (or into a normal glass and skip step 5)
3. Pour coconut syrup/cream/milk into glass
4. Pour pineapple juice into glass
5. Mix until creamy (either with mixer glass or stir it)
6. Pour into drinking glass and decorate it with pineapple pieces

## Conclusion
I personally don't have a mixxer glass and use Coconut syrup, a very nice drink for summer.
