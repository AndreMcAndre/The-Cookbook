* 800g beef tartare
* 4 egg yoaks
* 75g capers
* 4 table spoons freash grated horseradish
* One table spoon butter
* One table spoon olive oil
* 4 peaces of toast

## Materials
* Nothing special, just a pan

## Method
1. Start by forming the paddies on top of the bread, make sure they will stick to the bread, they should be big enguh to at least cover the toast bread
2. Season with salt and pepper
3. Heat up a pan with butter and cook the paddie with bread, steak down, untill they are golden brown flip the paddie bread combo and cook the bread untill it is crisp
4. Plate the pariserbøf with capers, grated horseradish and an egg yoak each, it can be a good idea to put the egg yoak on first so the rest of the toppings stick to the meat

## Conclusion
You will be presented with a really good "man" dish it might not be something to serve on a first date but for a football night with the boiz there is nothing better
