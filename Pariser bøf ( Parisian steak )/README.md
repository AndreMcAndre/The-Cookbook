Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients
* 800g beef tartare
* 4 egg yolks
* 75g capers
* 4 table spoons fresh grated horseradish
* One table spoon butter
* One table spoon olive oil
* 4 pieces of toast

## Materials
* Nothing special, just a pan

## Method
1. Start by forming the patties on top of the bread, make sure they will stick to the bread, they should be big enough to at least cover the toast bread
2. Season with salt and pepper
3. Heat up a pan with butter and cook the patty with bread, patty down, until they are golden brown, flip the patty-bread combo and cook the bread until it is crisp
4. Plate the pariserbøf with capers, grated horseradish and an egg yolk each, it can be a good idea to put the egg yolk on first so the rest of the toppings stick to the meat

## Conclusion
You will be presented with a really good "man" dish it might not be something to serve on a first date but for a football night with the boiz there is nothing better
