## Ingredients
* 4 eggs
* Milk
* 1 yogurt
* 1 or 2 tomatoes
* 1 can of tuna
* Mustard
* A roll of puff pastry
## Materials
* A pie plate
* An oven
* A big bowl
## Method
1. Cut your tomatoe(s) in slices.
2. Take a big bowl and put the eggs, the yogurt and a little bit of milk. Be careful, do not put too much milk or it will be too liquid.
3. Mix everything together.
4. Turn on your oven on 200Â°c.
5. Take the puff pastry and put it in the pie plate. 
6. Cover the bottom with mustard. I like to put a lot of mustard as it gives more taste to the quiche.
7. Open the tuna can. Crumble the tuna on the quiche, covering the bottom entirely.
8. Add the tomatoe slices.
9. Pour in the mix from step 2.
10.
